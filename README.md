## 🎮 Minecraft Enthusiast

When I'm not coding, I'm often exploring the pixelated world of **Minecraft**.  
🪓 Whether it's building massive redstone contraptions or surviving hardcore mode, I love the creativity and challenge Minecraft offers.  
Sometimes I even experiment with Minecraft modding and server management for fun.

> Favorite biome? Definitely **the mountains** 🏔  
> Dream build? A **fully automated city** with redstone tech and command block magic ⚙️✨
